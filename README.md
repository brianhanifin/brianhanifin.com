## Getting Started

### Preparation

Follow the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installtion of basic environment (Ruby, RubyGem, Bundler and Jekyll). In addition, to use the funny script tools, we also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(version 3.5 or abover) and [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/).

Next, [fork](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork) **Chirpy** and then clone your replicated repository locally.


### Install Jekyll Plugins

Go to root directory of the repository and run the following:

```terminal
$ bundle install
```

`bundle` will install all the dependent Jekyll Plugins listed in file `Gemfile` automatically.


### File Structure

The main files and related brief introductions are listed below.

```sh
jekyll-theme-chirpy/
├── _data
├── _includes      
├── _layouts
├── _posts          # posts stay here
├── _scripts
├── assets      
├── tabs
│   └── about.md    # the ABOUT page
├── .gitignore
├── .travis.yml     # remove it
├── 404.html
├── Gemfile
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── _config.yml     # configuration file
├── build.sh        # script tool
├── run.sh          # script tool
├── init.sh         # script tool
├── pv.sh           
├── feed.xml
├── index.html
├── robots.txt
├── search.json
└── sitemap.xml
```


### Configuration

Customize the variables in file `_config.yml` as needed.


### Atom Feed

The Atom feed url of your site will be:

```
<SITE_URL>/feed.xml
```

The `SITE_URL` was defined by variable `url` in file `_config.yml`.


###  Run Locally

You may want to preview the site before publishing, so just run the script tool:

```terminal
$ bash run.sh
```

>**Note**: The *Recent Update* list requires the latest git-log date of posts, thus make sure the changes in `_posts` have been committed before running this command.

Open a brower and visit <http://localhost:4000>.

Few days later, you may find that the file changes does not refresh in real time by using `run.sh`. Don't worry, the advanced option `-r` (or `--realtime`) will solve this problem, but it requires [**fswatch**](http://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/) to be installed on your machine.


###  Deploying to GitHub Pages

Before the deployment begins, ensure the `url` in `_config.yml` has been set to `https://<username>.github.io`.

#### Option 1: Built by GitHub Pages

By deploying your site in this way, you can push the source code to GitHub repository directly.

> **Note**: If you want to add any third-party Jekyll plugins or custom scripts to your project, please refer to [*Option 2: Build locally*](#option-2-build-locally).

**1**. Rename your repository as `<username>.github.io`.

**2**. Commit the changes of your repository, then run the initialization script:

```console
$ bash init.sh
```

It will automatically generates the *Latest Modified Date* and *Categories / Tags* page for the posts.

**3**. Push the changes to `origin/master` then go to GitHub website and enable GitHub Pages service for the repository `<username>.github.io`.

**4**. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` and enjoy.


#### Option 2: Build Locally

For security reasons, GitHub Pages runs on `safe` mode, which means the third-party Jekyll plugins or custom scripts will not work. If you want to use any another third-party Jekyll plugins, **your have to build locally rather than on GitHub Pages**.

**1**. On GitHub website, create a brand new repository with name `<username>.github.io` and then clone it locally.

**2**. Build your site by:

```console
$ bash build.sh -d /path/to/<username>.github.io/
```

The build results will be stored in the root directory of `<username>.github.io` and don't forget to push the changes of `<username>.github.io` to branch `master` on GitHub.

**3**. Go to GitHub website and enable GitHub Pages service for the new repository `<username>.github.io`.

**4**. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` and enjoy.
