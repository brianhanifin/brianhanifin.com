The image files of [Favicons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/about/) are placed in `assets/img/favicons`. You may need to replace them with your own. So let's see how to customize these Favicons.

Whit a square image (PNG, JPG or GIF) in hand, open the site [*Favicon & App Icon Generator*](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) and upload your original image.

![upload-image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/sample/upload-image.png)

Wait a moment for the website to generate icons of various sizes automatically.

![download-icons]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/sample/download-icons.png)

Download the generated package and extract to override the files in directory `assets/img/favicons`.

At last, rebuild the site so that the icon becomes your custom edition.
