## DIY Irrigation Controller Part 2

While my the Irrigation Controller can be manually started and stopped with physical buttons, the primary user interface was always intended to be built in Lovelace.

### Reliability Update

Before I describe how I created the interface I have great news! In the 2 months since I put the controller into service it has been rock solid! At the moment the Uptime is up to 248 hours since the last time it restarted. The only times it has been restarted has been once to upload a tweak to my ESPHome code, and the second one was for a neighborhood-wide power outage!!! :)

### Building A User Interface

Each Zone consists of the following:

1. Manual on/off switch.
2. Status Display showing: Is It Running, Next Scheduled Time, and Time Remaining.
3. Scheduler: field to enter a comma separated list of times, and a slider to select the runtime in minutes.

        margin: 0 0 -1em 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

              full_row: true
              hide_state: true
```

### Controller Status

At the bottom I include "glance" sensors displaying the status of the controller.

```yaml
  - type: glance
    entities:
      - entity: binary_sensor.irrigation_controller_status
        name: Status
      - entity: sensor.irrigation_controller_uptime
        name: Uptime
      - entity: sensor.irrigation_controller_wifi_signal
        name: WiFi Signal
```

Let me know if you have any questions.
