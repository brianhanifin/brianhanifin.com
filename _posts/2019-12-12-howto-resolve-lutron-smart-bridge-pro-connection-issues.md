I have a [Lutron Caseta Wireless Smart Bridge Pro (L-BDGPRO2-WH)][pro-bridge]. I was unable to connect to it with the app on my iPhone. I would get a “Cannot connect to your Lutron system.” error every time I tried.

After lots of troubleshooting, I was able to resolve it. If you have this problem try the following:

1. Delete the Lutron app.
2. Re-install the Lutron app.
3. Create a new account instead of logging into your old one.
4. Use a different Email address when you create this account.
5. Continue following the process until the bridge is added to the app!

I wanted to share this because I could not find anyone else suggesting this solution after searching for days on the Internet.
